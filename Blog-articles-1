After a bout of depression Laura found baking to be her savior, a way to channel her energies into feeding her family and doing something productive. Baking had a clear end-product and a methodical approach to creating. Using your hands to knead and cut is very therapeutic. Laura uses her friends and family and testers and hasn’t had a complaint yet!</p><blockquote><h2>Through baking and creating together Laura has found that her daughters will chat to her about all things related to school and friendship problems,</h2></blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Her young daughters have developed a growing interest in her hobby turned career and Laura has found it to be hugely beneficial in teaching mathematical skills, reading, patience, creativity and enhancing the bond between parents and child without the need for television or smart phones. Laura teaches her children to budget for ingredients whilst shopping, they learn whereabouts their food has come from, be it home grown, organically produced or reared locally. Laura tried to recycle packaging where appropriate thus reducing the impact on the environment and teaches her children to reduce waste.</p>

<blockquote><h2>Baking can teach children the importance of hygiene and health and safety and the fundamental importance of eating a healthy balanced diet.</h2></blockquote><p>Laura’s eldest child is now a very eager cook and likes to create her own recipes and help with dinner parties!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mindful Bakes aims to use freshly grown local produce. Their apples came from across Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and even east Sussex! Mindful Bakes tries to reduce waste by using people’s unwanted damsons, sloe berries, apples, pears, pumpkins and plums. In the winter Mindful Bakes produced game pies from pheasant, partridge and venison from local farms.</p><blockquote><h2>Mindful bakes aim to bring people together via cake and inadvertently people start chatting and hopefully this may involve discussions surrounding mental health.</h2></blockquote><p>They host regular ‘crumbs and chatter’ open days in the village. &nbsp;#oneconversationatatime #onecrumbatatime. Such events have increased Laura’s confidence in her social skills as well as enabling her to meet new people in a rural location. They also deliver cakes and bakes to local businesses who may not be able to access the local shops easily such as retirement homes and businesses in rural locations. Mindful Bakes endeavors to meet every client’s needs. They accept commissions and can provide gluten free, vegan, sugar free and dairy free cakes and bakes.</p><p>&nbsp; Laura studied Occupational Therapy so knows only too well about the importance of baking as a form of therapy. She has worked with special needs children and young adults for over fifteen years in various settings. Laura is keen to take Mindful Bakes into local primary schools as part of their Emotional Literacy and Social Support programme (ELSA) and to enable children to enable children to feel supported and listened to whilst undertaking a fun, therapeutic and educational activity.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;ELSA helped Laura’s eldest daughter aged six when she had a mental breakdown by reducing her anxiety and allowing her some ‘time out’ of the structured curriculum to immerse herself in something fun and relaxing as well as learning a new skill.</p><blockquote><h2>She was able to understand that it is ‘okay to not be okay’ and that there will always be people to listen to her, support her and share their experiences.</h2></blockquote><p>Many children are exposed to the stresses of modern day life and are not equipped with the coping mechanisms at such a young age on how to deal with them.&nbsp; It is important to start discussing mental health in a positive light before not becomes destructive at a later age. Mental health need not be scary and intimidating and Mindful Bakes wishes to herald the importance of incorporating baking into the education system as a way of discussing mental health.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mindful Bakes Cookery school sessions will last up to one hour including preparation time. All ingredients and materials will be provided, and children get to take home their creations! Laura will also be offering these sessions after school and during the school holidays in her own home for a maximum of five children at a time. Laura has a certificate in food hygiene and the relevant insurance. Please get in touch for times, dates and prices.</p><h2>We also thought we would let Laura tell you about Mindful Bakes in her own words:</h2><p><br>”I am absolutely passionate about working with children; teaching them new skills and educating them to eat healthfully, be mindful of what they are putting in their bodies and also where their food has come from.&nbsp; I want children to be mindful of how they feel when they’re baking, they’re not focusing on the latest television programme or tapping away on mobile phones or playstations. Baking requires your full concentration and effort so there is not much room for anything else. All the anxiety and distracting thoughts have to be put aside whilst you create your masterpiece. It also doesn’t need to be a masterpiece at all, cooking is subjective so there is no right or wrong, it is a learning process and if at first you don’t succeed you try, try again!</p><p>I am also passionate about being creative and artistic and I think that can be incorporated into cooking. I am not great at icing cakes and I do not place a huge emphasis on the final look of a product not the taste but i think it’s the process that went into creating that bake that is important. How did it make you feel? Did you enjoy it? What was challenging? What could you have done differently?</p><p>I set up my cookery school in February 2017 and invited children of all ages through my front door to bake with me, creating both sweet and savoury bakes. I ran 4 sessions a day at 75 minutes each from 10am till 4pm and we were pretty fully booked every half term. During term time i would invite ore school children through my doors and offer the same sessions.</p><blockquote><h3><strong>‘Where there is cake there is hope.’ The Depressed Cake Shop introduced the ‘grey cake’ movement in London in 2013.  It is now headquartered in Los Angeles.  Grey cakes symbolise the world of someone who is affected by mental health problems, where the ‘black dog’ of anxiety and depression can feel overwhelming, colouring their experience of life.’</strong></h3></blockquote><p>As part of World Mental Health day Laura held a bake sale in her local village hall after school to raise money for the Royals charity, Heads Together. This wonderful charity raises awareness of mental health issues and support children and young people, teaching them that it’s ‘okay not to be okay’. As you can see from the photos all the bakes were grey to symbolise the struggle people have with depression. We are so proud to say that she raised a whopping £107 in an hour! Last year they raised £380 for the charity Mind and i hope to raise money for mental health charities every year. Mindful Bakes is very dedicated to supporting children to maintain a healthy attitude towards metal health and be mindful of how they feel on an everyday basis. Laura personally found baking to be my savior after a bout of depression and anxiety and it continues to be a great therapeutic tool for her</p>

<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about yourself.&nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><p>My name is Andrea and I'm 27. I have only been baking for about 6 years and my passion for it started with planning my kids'&nbsp;(Sawyer and Remi's) birthday parties. I love making art in any sense of the word and I love that I have found a way to turn it into a living!&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>How did you hear about Depressed Cake Shop?</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The wonderful world of Facebook! I'm not even sure who shared it now but I literally cried when I watched the video about it.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Why did you decide to pop up a shop?</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I am putting on a <strong>Depressed Cake Shop</strong> for many reasons. First to bring awareness to suicide and mental illness. It is affecting so many people in our small town. When I found this organization I knew I wanted to be a part of it. I couldn't pin point the reason why for a while but now I know. I have bi polar disorder and I have gone back and forth for years of being between being ok or not. I started baking cakes and cupcakes for my kids birthdays about 6 years ago and I would just get so into it. The planning, baking, invites everything would take up like 3 months of my year. While I was planning each thing I would be so happy and excited I just wanted that feeling all the time. I decided to start my own bakery after a lot of encouragement from the people around me. I've realized it makes me calm. It gives me something to look forward to and balance my life around and be proud of. I hate the way some people say "oh I can't make a decision I'm so bipolar" as a joke. I do not find things like that funny. I want to throw this event and show maybe even a couple people that things like that are serious and you never know who around you has some sort of mental illness. I just think this is such an awesome way to fight the stigma and it couldn't have spoken to me on a more personal level.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the one thing you hope people will take away from their visit to your pop up?</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>That so many more people suffer from a mental illness than anyone realizes. Someone can seem to be a functioning human maybe even with a smile on their face all day but go home and cry their eyes out and maybe not even know why. If it makes at least one person not feel alone somehow then I think that will be enough for me.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>If you could talk to your younger self what would you tell her?</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It sounds so cliche really but just follow your heart and forget what anyone has to say about you. Be your own person and don't let anyone boss you around. Make your own happiness and live it.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>What is your favorite thing to bake? </strong>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>My favorite thing to bake is probably just muffins but I love decorating cookies. Royal icing is just so endless in creative possibilities. It's like painting on a cookie!&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<p class="">The first thing I did was start to look through photos of the past few years. &nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds and hundreds of pictures of women and cakes --&nbsp;and a lot of men too, to be fair,&nbsp;but today is about the women.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong><em>" Not all of us can do great things, but we can do small things with great love." -- Mother Teresa</em></strong></p><p class="">Our tribe is strong. &nbsp;The women who surround us lift us up with love and courage, but there is one man that must have special mention here today. &nbsp;&nbsp;I have continued with the DCS all these years in honor of my dad who was my hero.&nbsp;He battled with his mental health his entire life. &nbsp;He often won. He was an incredible husband and father, a loyal friend, and the most generous man I have ever met. &nbsp;He loved to inspire people with quotes, so here are a few that I think he would have liked to kick off this photo gallery.</p>

Whether it is hot yoga, yoga on music, slow yoga, fast yoga, yoga on the beach or yoga in India, yoga works as long as you don't injure yourself. Today I will not get into how yoga affects people's bodies, rather how it affects their mind and why it can tremendously help people's mental well being. </span></p><p><span>My first yoga class was in high school on a special event day. I thought it was kind of funny and I actually don't remember much of it besides that I fell asleep in Savasana and woke up as happy as can be. Life went on until I did another yoga class. My next one was soon after I moved to Los Angeles and a few years later I became a teacher, then a few years after that, I became an advocate for Mental Health. </span></p><p><span>The secret to yoga is to try it and do it more than once. You must try many to find the right style and the right teachers. You will hear a lot of things on your quest but since today we focus mainly on the mental benefits of yoga, I can tell you with certitude that in terms of mental well- being one style isn't better than another and a teacher isn't better than another. It's about what's best for you. Everyone has an opinion according to what works for them and it does not mean it will nor should work for you. Yoga is highly customizable and as long as it makes someone happy I don't care if it is naked yoga or yoga on a surf board with your dog. </span></p><h1><span>So, why does yoga make people so happy? </span></h1><p><span>Yoga means "to unite". It's the union of you. It's creating a healthy connection between the mind and body using the breath and then eventually creating a healthy connection between you and the world around you. </span></p><p><span>Many mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety are extremely isolating and make people who suffer feel out of touch not only with the world, but with their own body, and unable to control let alone stop those thoughts that push their mind deeper into the illness. </span></p><p><span>I'm not claiming that yoga cures mental illness but it can help manage it. The idea behind yoga is to experience the body in order to control the mind and stop the out of control spiraling thoughts before one falls too deep in mental despair. </span></p><p><span>Once you have found a style and teachers that you like and have been practicing regularly (I said regularly not excessively), you will become more aware of your body, how it responds to certain poses on certain days and most importantly how your mind responds to it all. Slowly, using your breath you will be able to control the constant fluctuation of the mind throughout a class and eventually throughout your day. </span></p><p><span>I believe that happiness is when your body and mind are in the state of equilibrium. Don't make happiness a goal or define it by perfection because perfection does not exist. Your body will experience aches and pains and your mind will always experience some ups and downs. What yoga does is it helps you manage and achieve balance so you can prevent physical injuries, and mental melt downs. Happiness is not an achievement but a journey and yoga can be part of that journey. </span></p><p><span>If you are still nervous about attending a yoga class here are a few things you can do at home to make your first class a bit easier. You can also do this when you don't have time to go to a class. </span></p><h1><strong>Yoga Tips to Try on your Own</strong></h1><blockquote><strong>Breathing (Pranayama) </strong></blockquote><p><span>Pranayama techniques are beneficial in treating a range of stress related disorder. It improves the autonomic functions and It reduces the signs of oxidative stress in the body.&nbsp;</span><span>Practicing pranayama can assist in steady mind, strong will power and sound judgement. </span></p><ul><li><span>Sit comfortably on the floor, pillow cross legged or on a chair with your feet firmly on the floor. </span></li><li><span>Start with 10 rounds with breathing through the left nostril and 10 rounds breathing with the right. </span></li><li><span>Repeat as many time as you want. </span></li></ul><blockquote><strong>Poses </strong><em>(Asanas) </em></blockquote><h2><strong><span>1) Downward-Facing Dog </span></strong><em><span>(Adho Mukha Svanasana)</span></em></h2><p><span><strong>Benefits:</strong> Down Dog combats <strong>anxiety</strong> and energizes the body which helps with <strong>depression</strong>. </span></p><ul><li><span>Lie on your stomach with your palms by the sides of your chest with your fingers well spread. </span></li><li><span>Come onto your hands and knees. </span></li><li><span>Turn the toes under, and exhale as you raise your buttocks high in the air, moving your thighs up and back.

<p>Seattle Pacific University's NAMI chapter hosted a very successful pop-up on campus Friday, April 29th. They almost sold out of everything and made over $800 -- "which for selling things to poor college students, is really awesome" jokes one of the organizers, Carl Sallee.&nbsp;"It was crowded at the table almost the whole time and we spread a lot of awareness."&nbsp;</p>

This year the club officers (Hannah Miller, Kaylyn Springer, Sarah McDermott)&nbsp;and myself decided that we wanted people to know that the club existed on campus and that it has been behind-the-scenes working for mental illness awareness and support for years. We wanted that work to come out from behind the scenes and in to the public eye, so<strong> what a better way than a creative bake sale?!</strong></p><p><strong>We were excited that this was no ordinary bake sale, but one that could educate and de-stigmatize an issue that touches everyone's lives at the same time. </strong>So when I heard about the idea and how successful it was in Capitol Hill,&nbsp;Seattle in the fall, I wanted to bring it to campus - where some of the most influential people our world is about to receive are being educated and trained to make a difference.</p><p>I wanted to be able to spread the word about mental illness to these people so that when they are going out in to the world, they will know it is OK to openly discuss mental illness, but it is not OK to treat people who are affected by it in a way that is less respectful, loving, or accepting than they would anyone else.</p><p>I also wanted to support NAMI and inform people about how effective and important its advocacy work and support network is as an institution. We had an amazing turnout and a blast putting it on and we hope that it can become an annual event for the future SPU NAMI clubs to organize from here on out!</p><p>Thanks for the support, Depressed Cake Shop!"</p><p>-Carl Sallee, SPU</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
